## Description
The Semantic Web languages OWL and RDF enable knowledge representation by means of a Knowledge Base, i.e., a knowledge repository - not just a database. Knowledge Base consists of two parts: ontology and individuals, i.e., instances of classes in the ontology. Developed Alarm-Warning KB shows the statements of the System according to the values of sensors in given time. Types of used notations: _N3, json, latex, owl, owl Manchester, owl functional, rdf, turtle._
