## Description
The Semantic Web languages OWL and RDF enable knowledge representation by means of a Knowledge Base, i.e., a knowledge repository - not just a database. Knowledge base consists of two parts: ontology and individuals, i.e., instances of classes in the ontology. 

## Concept maps for organizing and representing knowledge
Words on the line, referred to as linking words or linking phrases, specify the relationship between the two concepts.
